# Collatz-tool
GUI tool to calculate and plot Collatz sequences for single numbers, lists, and ranges.

## ✨ Features

- Simulate the Collatz sequence for:
  - A **single number**
  - A **custom list** of numbers
  - A **number range**
- Visual plots showing:
  - Start value (green)
  - Highest value reached (blue)
  - Stop time (red)
- Simple and modern GUI built in pure Python

## 🧠 About the Collatz Sequence

For any positive integer `n`:
- If `n` is even → divide it by 2  
- If `n` is odd → multiply by 3 and add 1

Repeat until you reach 1.  
Despite its simplicity, the sequence exhibits surprisingly complex behavior — a famous unsolved problem in mathematics.
